1.To remove extra texts that are present inside label element,
there are 2 ways:
    (a)either use predefined words like 'require' or 'isrequired'
    and remove it.
    (b)use tokenizer to find words similar to 'required' and remove it. this will cover all words simlar 
    to required but one thing to take care is the threshold
    (c) keep in mind position of these extra words , also special symbol like '*' often used for required field
One more thing: when we use element.get_text() where element is an html element we get all the texts present concatenated
So there can be a span like this <span>First Name [require]</span> or <span>First name</span> <span>required</span>.
so we want space between field name and 'required' word.This is not possible when they are in seprate elements coz .get_text() will concat 
the words.
